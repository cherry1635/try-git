Any large software as Git are come with complicated.

type // git remote -v // will show.
fetch_name	fetch_address
push_name	push_address

// git pull // copy changes from a remote repo to Local.

# Should I use git fetch or git pull?
If your workspace has no uncommitted files, and you want to copy the latest changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, then issue the git pull command.

If you want to pull down the latest changes from a remote repository without overwriting anything in your working directory, then use git fetch, and then do a git merge when the time is right.
