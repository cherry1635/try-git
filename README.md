# Try Git
Hello, This is Cherrise, and very glad to introduce Git for you.

Git is complicated at first, please keep patience in reading tutorial.

A official name of Git is Version Control System. But I prefer to describe Git as "project file recorded tool".
In source code level, git is implemented by file system support.

I don't hope you to ask why it should define  such a function, it was just a software design, it' cool or bad, just accept at the first glance. It will be clear to the final time. Don't be hurry.

If you are new, please follow the order of the chapters, because you should know some basic knowledges before you go to deeper usage.
