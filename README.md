# Try Git
Hello, This is Cherrise, and it's nice to introduce Git for you.

Git is complicated at first, so keep patience with this tutorial.

An official name of Git is Version Control System, but I prefer describe Git as "project file recorded tool".
In source code level, Git was implemented by file system support.


If you are new, please follow the order of the chapters, because you should know some basic knowledges before you go to deeper functions.

<h3>Why you should use git?</h3>

I say git is good at in recording the file changes, to compare differences.
If you edited a file, every seconds there is a file updates. And you can't go back, because you can't turn back time.
I would like to say git is a camera which can take photo, and its service object is a file, the most useful for git is to take photo on files. So that was the basic principle that git can record the file history.

Git functions: give you more flexible space to make you writing choices.
