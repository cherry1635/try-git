**why public key is not enough and we need digital signature?**
While a public key is used for encryption and verifying digital signatures, it is not sufficient on its own to ensure data integrity and authenticity. The following reasons explain why a digital signature is necessary:

Data Integrity: The primary purpose of a digital signature is to ensure data integrity. By applying a digital signature to a message or data, any alteration or tampering with the data will be detected during the signature verification process. The recipient can verify that the data has not been modified since it was signed.

Non-Repudiation: Digital signatures provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot later deny their involvement in signing the data. Once a digital signature is applied, it provides evidence that the signer approved and authenticated the data.

Authentication: Digital signatures provide authentication of the signer's identity. By verifying the digital signature using the corresponding public key, recipients can confirm that the data was signed by the private key holder associated with that public key. This ensures that the data originated from the claimed source and has not been tampered with.

Trust: Digital signatures rely on asymmetric cryptography, which uses a key pair consisting of a private key (kept secret by the signer) and a public key (distributed to others). The public key is used to verify the digital signature. By trusting the integrity and security of the public key, recipients can trust the authenticity and integrity of the signed data.

In summary, while a public key can be used to encrypt data and verify signatures, a digital signature is essential for ensuring data integrity, providing non-repudiation, authenticating the signer's identity, and establishing trust in the data and its source. The combination of encryption with a public key and digital signatures provides a comprehensive solution for secure communication and data validation.
